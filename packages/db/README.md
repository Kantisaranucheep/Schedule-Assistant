# Database Package

This package contains shared database utilities and types that can be used across multiple applications in the monorepo.

## Purpose

- Shared database connection utilities
- Common database types and interfaces
- Database migration helpers

## Usage

This is a placeholder for future shared database code. Currently, the database logic resides in `apps/backend/app/core/db.py`.

## Future Considerations

- Extract common SQLAlchemy base classes
- Shared type definitions
- Connection pool management utilities
